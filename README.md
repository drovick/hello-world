# hello-world
just following orders (the tutorial dummy)


Wassup. My name is Dave and I hate boring shit. Most hardware is boring shit. The idea of feedback systems is cool but the 
module "Control" is boring shit. I don't mind Digital Electronics but our first year lecturer is so boring that I forgot his 
name. I don't really enjoy Signals Processing but we have awesome lecturers for that so it's bless.

I like big picture conceptual thinking. Bring on Comp Arch. Bring on programming. Allow the wastemen that like detail (but 
have respect and empathy for every individual). Detail is boring shit. Always fuck the detail. jk. it's important. but boring 
as shit. hire someone else to do it. make $$$.

Anyway thanks for reading imma go back to studying the details now. safe.
